# sciter files

This is a [sciter.js](https://sciter.com/) project that experiments with the filesystem.

It explores how to async/sync create, read, write and delete both files and directories.

## demo

- git clone the repository
- on Mac only `chmod +x install.sh start.sh`
- run `install.bat` on Windows or `./install.sh` on Mac to download the latest sciter binaries and the sciter package manager
- install packages `php bin/spm.phar install`
- run `start.bat` or `./start.sh`
